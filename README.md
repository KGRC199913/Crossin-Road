# Crossing Road


## Coding Conventions:

1. Use camelCase for variable's name, class's name


2. Use snake_case for function's name and method's name


3. Write comment on top of every function and method to explain: (paramters and return): value + type, exceptions (if available)


4. Follow DRY, YAGNI & KISS


5. Follow naming conventions


    5.1 Use stroustrup style for if-else, do-while, etc
    
    
    5.2 1 class = 1 .h file and 1 .cpp file, do **NOT** put 2 classes into 1 file .h


6. Refactor and optimize continously


7. **Self Driven**
